# LocalWebPlayer

Play media from direct link with subtitle

# dependancy

* [subsrt.js]
* bootstrap 5
* Jquery
* Plyr
* subplayerjs

# To do

* [ ] Subplayer should not use blob -> or handle blob file in subplayer
* [ ] more Jquery?
* [ ] complex ass and ssa problem -> these file conversion is incomplete (subsrt problem? or boundled?)
* [ ] subtitle from remote origin -> 'file:' URLs are treated as unique security origins.
